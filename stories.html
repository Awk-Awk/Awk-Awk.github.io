        <div class="content">
            <p>
            "One Saturday morning last November, 
            it was raining just lightly enough not to need an umbrella. 
            I was walking up the quay overlooking the deserted docks. 
            I saw a sea lioness giving birth to a cub on a sandbar. 
            Then came their natural predators, the sea bears. 
            No, I did not make up sea bears. 
            Check the Royal Bestiary for yourself. 
            What next, you ask? The only thing I could. 
            I shot the sea lioness and her cub and threw their bodies into the water. 
            Deceived, the sea bears jumped after them and drowned. 
            That is how I saved their would-be prey."
            </p>
            <p>
            "Well done, sir! 
            Your story reminds me of the time my brothers and I were hunting the sea lions of Bermuda. 
            We thought we had them when we saw their dead bodies in the water, so we jumped in to feast.
            Only then did we remember we could not swim. 
            That is how I ended up at the tavern, waiting my turn for life-restoring liquid.
            No, it was not a dream. 
            How else would I be here?"
            </p>
            <p>
            "I know not how any more than I know your name, 
            Arnold... Barrie? Clarence? Douglas? Edward? Ferdinand? Gary? Harold? 
            Ignacio? James? Karl? Laurel? Max? No, it's Ned, right? 
            Orson? Peter? Quentin? Roger? Sam? Timothy? Urijah? Vance? Walter? Xander? 
            No, surely it is Yanni... or Zachary."
            </p>
            <p>
            "You guess wrong, but I did know some fishermen with those names. 
            Let us start with Arnold. 
            What can I say? 
            He was not that bright, but he was quick on his feat and 
            resourceful in the face of adversity, 
            like the time he successfully breached a naval blockade surrounding Barbados. 
            It was during the Grea Sea Serpent War of 1892. 
            No, not Great. Not Grey, either. Grea, it was, 
            for that was the best way to describe it. 
            How did he do this, you ask? 
            He played a flute that made the sea serpents fall asleep and 
            release their hold on the ships that were stuck in the harbor. 
            The timing could not have been better, because one more day 
            and they would not have been able to return with food 
            before the women and children perished."
            </p>
            <p>
            "Let me guess... Barrie must have been Arnold's companion. 
            He probably died of old age, right when he could finally 
            enjoy the fruits of his life-long sea snake herding. 
            At least his son Clarence could live a comfortable life on the shores of Nantuck.
            Am I right?"

        <button class="collapsible">Return To Salmon's Head</button>

            <div class="content">
                <p>All rivers lead to the sea. At least, that is what his grandmother used to tell him before he learned to talk. He used to take comfort in that. With every passing year, though, the old man's doubts grew. Warming his hands with his second cup of thornmilk tea, he glanced down at the Mawnetucket River, an indigo worm grasping its way through a desert of cold gray rocks. He no longer remembered how he had ended up alone in this crumbling monastery atop Mt. Burr. All he knew for sure was that he was born to rule Salmon's Head, an island on the other side of the moon. The sole survivor of a shipwreck when he was months old, he had always craved the sea, even though it might be his doom instead of his salvation. Still, it was his only hope of returning to the home he hardly knew and fulfilling his destiny. As soon as he made it down to the Mawnetucket, it would one day deliver him to the South Atlantic, whose waters he had last glimpsed a decade ago. Even though the sky was seldom clear enough to see it from such a distance, he knew it was out there in the fog. Sighing, he sipped his tea as thirteen ravens circled overhead.</p>
                <p>Sailing down the river would be out of the question, of course. It was too shallow and often froze, and there were waterfalls scattered throughout. He would have to make his own path parallel to it, avoiding the raptors as he went. If he made it alive to the gulf, he would have to learn how to build a ship and sail it. Without a navigation chart, he would have to trust the South Star to guide him; whether or not its light still came from a living star was of little importance now.</p>
                <p>It was not an easy decision to leave. There were certain comforts in the predictability of his life. Waking up in the light of the rising sun. The daily stroll around the summit of Mt. Burr. Making crabapple jam. Raven pot pie for dinner. Falling asleep by the fireplace with a book from the library, with seven lifetimes' worth of books left to read. He already missed these memories, and would miss them even more soon. However, a deep longing in his DNA for the sea and his island home drove him on. His mind made up, but unconfident in his decision, the old man had a desperate idea. He made sure the door was locked and began to grind his key on the cliff. It took him an hour to grind it down to dust. Too late to turn back now, he started down the mountain path. The ravens followed.</p>
            </div>
            <button class="collapsible">Leaving Home To Go Home</button>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Not yet fully aware of what he was leaving behind, the old man hiked steadily down Mt. Burr. He hoped the eighteen hours of daylight would be enough time to reach the Mawnetucket. Even by day, the path was treacherous. Many a monk had impaled a foot on jagged rock long ago. With or without starlight, a journey by night would be impossible.</p>
                <p>It was a long, slow trek down, mostly on hands and feet to keep from slipping. He passed two raptor's nests on his left and three on his right. Except for shrubs here and there, all he had for landmarks was the sight of the river. He knew he was halfway down when it reached the width of a snake. By the time he reached the base of the mountain, it was the width of a rock serpent.</p> 
                <p>The old man's stomach began to rumble in pain. It must be the thornmilk tea, he reasoned. He knew he should have let it boil longer. He once took it in the hope of recovering lost memories, but he only drank it out of habit now. The day exhausted, he laid himself down between two boulders blocking the wind. He slept restlessly.</p>
                ...
                <p>Before the disaster, the Order of St. George had occupied Our Lady of Fire Monastery for centuries. Even though the founder was exiled to Mt. Burr on the mainland for heresy, the monks became friends of the Island King in later days. They had their Abbot to thank for this new alliance. Every July he visited the hostile coastal tribes, civilizing them one by one. This was a godsend for Salmon's Head because piracy had been an everlasting threat. On one of those winter mornings, the Abbot was meditating on the beach when he found an infant washed up on the shore clutching a letter. He gathered it up in his cloak and brought it back to the monastery to raise it. As a young man, he would officially join the order as a Brother.</p>
                <p>On the longest night of the year, the young man was serving at the altar. Breathing the incense-filled air as they did at every mass and hoped to continue breathing on the other side of the grave, all the monks were chanting the communion hymn. It was the darkest hour when the messenger arrived. "I bring news from Salmon's Head," said he. "What has happened there will certainly happen here. Your heir will only understand when it is too late." With that, he collapsed to the floor. The healer ran up to check on him and found open sores on his chest and back. A smell of rotting fish filled the air. Only the young man could not smell it. One by one, the monks began to fall asleep forever until there were two left. "Promise me," implored the Abbot, "that you will abide here until the Lord Christ returns. You must keep the key with you and never lose it. It is your destiny to protect our mountain land so that life may remain." The young man swore on his name.</p>
            </div>
            <button class="collapsible">Home Is Where The Heart Is</button>
            <div class="content">
                <p>The old man woke up with an aching back, a sore stomach and a sinking conscience. Having forsaken his key, he knew it was too late to turn back. May God forgive him in this life or the next! Looking forward, he had a new destiny to fulfill, and that was to help his people recover from their own epidemic. His island kingdom awaited.</p>
                <p>He walked all morning and all afternoon, always keeping the river in sight. Every so often, he had to take a detour around a raptor's nest. His luck ran out that night. He did not notice the black and white reptile in the dark until it scraped his arm with its claws. It prepared to make another lunge when three of the thirteen ravens flew down and pecked at its neck. The lizard turned around and devoured them. As it began to pursue its bigger prey, it slipped on the birds' blood and broke its neck on a stone pillar jutting out of the rocky ground. The old man was safe, if only for now.</p>
                <p>Two hundred miles and one week later, he reached the abandoned highway that would take him the remaining three hundred miles to the Gulf of Mawnetucket, and the South Atlantic. The raptor meat he had tried had made him ill. Before he could go on, he had to summon two more of the ravens into the campfire. Only then would he have enough energy to continue.</p>
                <p>The old man's joy was indescribable when the cold desert air filled with the aroma of the still-distant sea. Despite living inland for most of his life, he had never forgotten the salty smell of the air he was born into. Rejuvenated, he now walked twice as fast without sleep for two days. At long last, the abandoned highway gave way to an abandoned seaport. Weary with blissful sorrow for what was lost and found again, he broke into an inn. After the ravens cleaned his room of rats, he fell onto the floor and slept like the grave.</p>
                ...
                <p>The pastel pink leaves were beginning to turn white and fall to the ground, as they did every June on Salmon's Head. The Island King was drafting a letter of pardon for the monks on Mt. Burr. Even though his ancestor had overthrown the last dynasty due to a schism between the Church and the Order of St. George, he was ready to end their exile. He had them to thank for their role in ending piracy. At any rate, the founder's dangerous ideas were not so dangerous these days. Their biggest remaining difference had to do with the music of the liturgy. The monks chanted in a harmonic minor key, whereas the Church preferred hymns in a melodic minor scale. Despite their unorthodox views, he needed their help.</p>
                <p>You see, the Island King was the twelfth of his royal name. His newborn son would be the thirteenth. He worried for the future of the throne. The peasants and the merchants were burdened by his latest tax hike, necessary for regrowing the Salmon Pink Forest. Most of the nobles were angry with his decision to restrict logging, hunting and fishing. If the monks were able to convert most of the pirates, perhaps they could convince his people of the wisdom of protecting the island's environment.</p>
                <p>The Prime Minister came in and kneeled. "Rise," said the King. "I have always wanted your friendship, never your knee. I need to ask you a favor."</p>
                <p>"Anything, my King," said the Minister. "Even if it means giving my life for you."
                <p>"I would rather you live long and well in my service, my friend. Evil days are coming. I know there is a conspiracy of nobles to lead a peasant revolt and overthrow me. If something happens to me, only you can protect my son. Will you consent to be his Godfather?"</p>
                <p>"On my honor and on my name," said the Minister. At that moment, the Captain of the Guard burst in. He ran at the King with his sword, but the Minister jumped between them. He lost two fingers on his left hand and three on his right as he tried to pry the sword away. The traitor was about to kill them both when a still-faithful guard caught up to him and blocked his sword with his axe. Both men fought for another five seconds until they severed each other's heads.</p>
                <p>The Island King tore some fabric off his robe and bandaged the Prime Minster's wounds as best as he could. "It is just as I feared," said he. "The conspiracy has already begun. I trust you with my life, as you almost died for me. Take charge of the Royal Guard. Make a thorough investigation. If there are any traitors left, throw them in the dungeon until their time of judgment."</p>
                <p>"Yes, my King," gasped the Prime Minister, fainting. The healer rushed in with medicine. The priest followed close behind with oil.</p>               
            </div>
            <button class="collapsible">Home, Sweet Home</button>
            <div class="content">
                <p>At the port library, the old man found a book on shipbuilding and another on sailing. It took him a month to read them because he had to gently turn the pages one by one so they would not crack, or worse, disintegrate into dust. Meanwhile, he worked desperately on his boat. Upon his homecoming, he hoped a loyal steward would be there to welcome him. He hoped for answers about what had happened to his father and godfather, and how he had ended up so far from home.</p>
                <p>The old man had never known anything about shipbuilding or sailing. However, the more the read, the more familiar it seemed to him. It was as if he had inherited this knowledge from his ancestors, and he only had to resurrect it. He finished his ship on the last day of summer. He studied the stars from the deck. It was a clear night and most of the constellations were visible, but not Pisces. It was surely just a coincidence.</p>
                <p>The old man settled into his cabin for supper. Thankfully, he would not have to eat any more of his ravens as long as they caught enough food for him. Tonight's catch was only squid, but he had no complaints. As he read a book of poetry dedicated to the ocean's bounty, he gradually nodded off to sleep.</p>
                ...
                <p>The Prime Minister was receiving petitioners as was his habit at this time of the morning. His last visitor was one he would rather forget. "It was me," the visitor said in greeting.</p>
                <p>"You!" screamed the Prime Minister.
                <p>"Do not turn me in unless you want everyone to know the truth about you." You see, this visitor was the Pirate Captain. That is, if you can still call a captain without a crew a captain. All his men had given up their old ways when they converted, leaving him to wander the seas alone.</p>
                <p>"You bribed the Captain of the Guard to turn against the Island King, and now you dare tell lies about me?" asked the Prime Minister, outraged.</p>
                <p>"What kind of lie comes with proof?" retorted the Pirate Captain. "I have receipts of all the games of Fishbones that we played, and of all the money that you owe me. What is more, three of your servants have told me how much you have stolen from the Royal Treasury."</p>
                <p>The Prime Minister's face went from defiant to sick with guilt. "What do you want from me? Oh, if only I had died protecting my King in the assassination attempt!"</p>
                <p>"Nobody has to know," assured the Pirate Captain, "If you can do me this favor. This is your only chance to save your reputation and your name. The Island King has destroyed the economy of Salmon's Head. The more taxes there are and the less wealth there is from logging, hunting and fishing, the less there is for me to plunder. You must convince him to lower taxes again and put trade before the environment. Also, my brother wishes to mine for saturnium on your island. He will expect a royal welcome, or I will be disappointed in you."</p>
                <p>"You ask for too much. The Island King will never agree to this."</p>
                <p>"Figure it out, or suffer the consequences. Where is the problem? After all, you command the Royal Guard now."</p>
                ...
                <p>As the old man slept restlessly, the fog covering Pisces cleared up. A blood-red shooting star passed through the constellation.</p>
                ...
                <p>A week later, Parliament convened for its monthly meeting. The Prime Minister was nervous with dread, but not because he was afraid of failure. Under martial law, he was given authority to judge and sentence suspected traitors without trial. Everyone who could resist his plot was already dead. No, he was hesitant to betray his friend. He had no choice, though. It was his friend's life or his own honor.</p>
                <p>The Island King began to speak. "My Lords," he began, "Our island is facing evil days. For generations, the Salmon Pink Forest has been shrinking. For ages, we have been catching too many fish, more quickly than they can reproduce. Unless we act now, it will be too late. I understand the sacrifices you have made and the losses you have suffered under my new laws. I know the common people are starving. Even I have had to give up hunting, my boyhood hobby. Even so, I have no regrets. Everything I do is for the future of Salmon's Head. To teach you patience and humility as you get used to a simpler way of life, I am pardoning the Order of St. George and inviting the monks home from exile. Your hearts grieve now, but they will fill with joy in the end. I promise you this on my royal name."</p>
                <p>"My King," said the Prime Minister. "The monks of St. George are heretics. Their dangerous ideas will threaten our kingdom's peace more than piracy ever did. I will be sad to see our island's natural beauty disappear, but there is no gold in beauty. It is our economy that makes us great. It is too precious to throw away. Rather, let us mine for saturnium and build weapons that will conquer other lands. You have been a King for too long. Would you not be an Emperor instead?" He said this with a grain of hope in his heart. Maybe his argument would be convincing.</p>
                <p>"I am not convinced," replied the Island King, "that there is any value in gold. Neither is there any glory in military might if nature is the cost. As long as I rule Salmon's Head, this will never come to pass."</p>
                <p>"So be it," declared his minister with sorrow and regret. "You have betrayed your kingdom. You will surely die." The guards approached the throne.</p>
                <p>"No," said the king. His face showed neither shock nor disappointment, but resignation to his fate. "You will execute me yourself. That is my last command." The minister took a fish spine sword from one of the guards and obeyed.</p>             
            </div>
            <button class="collapsible">Homeward Bound</button>
            <div class="content">
               	<p>The old man was full of anger and despair. He only had one destiny to live for now, and that was vengeance. He knew he would be unwelcome as a monk, so he dyed his cloak and tunic gray. He fashioned three daggers out of fishbones and hid them in his robes. His only hope of revenge would be for the Prime Minister and his guards to mistake him for a beggar. Even if he succeeded, he would surely die.</p>
                <p>He set sail that morning. Two hours later, he passed between the two islets that marked the boundary between the Gulf of Mawnetucket and the South Atlantic. He sailed all autumn. Star by star, the fog started to cover Pisces until the constellation was no longer visible. Meanwhile, food was getting scarcer every night. He had eaten seven more of his ravens by June, so only one remained. He needed it alive so it could guide him by day.</p> 
                <p>At the end of June, the ship was only a hundred miles away from shore when the hurricane hit. He sailed heroically for days. Nonetheless, each passing wave tore a plank off the boat. When a sudden rush of wind ripped the wheel from the deck, he dived into the sea. He swam over every wave for hours until the tallest one knocked him unconscious.</p>
                ...
                <p>At the beginning of July, the trees on Salmon's Head would have been bare. However, they were all gone now. The Pirate Captain and his brother were observing the saturnium mines from the atomsmith tower. Ever since the Prime Minister's suicide, they were in power. Food was running out on land and sea, but it mattered little. Soon there would be enough time spears and swords of eternity for the people to vanquish larger armies and conquer more prosperous lands. Finding resources would never be a problem again.</p>
                <p>On the day of the disaster, the grandmother was finishing her letter. She would not survive the journey, but she had to save her grandson, the heir to the throne. Even if they could remain anonymous for much longer, she did not want this kind of life for him. They set sail late that afternoon. Salmon's Head was disappearing with the sun under the horizon when the explosion occurred. A cloud shaped like a sea fungus crowned the island. They only felt a rush of heat at this distance, but it would be enough to mark the infant forever.</p> 
            </div>
            <button class="collapsible">Homecoming</button>
            <div class="content">
                <p>It was high tide on Salmon's Head. The last remaining raven had fallen into the waves a hundred miles away. As his dying body washed upon the ash-covered shore, the old man glanced up at the volcanoes in the distance where a river of saturnium-polluted water flowed mournfully between them. The atomsmith tower was in decay, as were the ruins of schools and churches. The docks and the castle were starting to crumble, but holding up against erosion for now. All that was missing were people and other living beings, and he must join them soon. It all made sense, now. Gasping in the sooty air one last time, he knew he was home.</p>
            ...
            <p>The winds howled throughout their journey. The grandmother told the infant stories by day and sang lullabies by night. With Salmon's Head now a lifeless corpse, the family name's only hope of survival lay on the continent. The hurricane hit with their destination another hundred miles to the Southeast. The South Star struggled to shine through the fog, and the sea grew more restless with every hour. As soon as the boat began to take on water, the grandmother knew the sacrifice she must make. Cradling the infant in her arms one last time, she pleaded, "Your only destiny now is to live, and the family name will live with you. Never try to come back home. It will be your death."
