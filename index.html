            The above photo is from a walk I took on a cold fall day.

        <p>
            This picture is inspired by a Chinese idiom, 热锅上蚂蚁, meaning "ants on a hot pan."
            It depicts my struggles and frustrations as I strive to reach the level of the artists I admire.

        <p>
            We parked at the beach and 
            rolled the windows down to let in the autumn sea breeze and enjoyed the sunset over the harbor from our car. 
            Maybe one day one of those houses will be ours!

             Drawing different cute poses is a relaxing thing for me.

            My husband and I at a lake. 
            With nothing better to do at the beginning of our weekend, 
            we enjoyed ourselves by stretching on the dock.
